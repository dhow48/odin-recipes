    <h2>The Best Creamy Chicken and Leek Risotto</h2>
    <p>This chicken and leek risotto is so creamy and rich! With the addition of green peas this dish makes the perfect
        meal or side dish that your whole family will love.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoon butter (use coconut oil for dairy free)</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts, chopped into bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped leeks</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
        <li>5 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot on the stove on medium heat and add the butter. Once melted add the chicken and cook for
            8-10 minutes, turning every couple minutes to cook all sides of the chicken evenly.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped leeks and minced garlic and cook for a couple more minutes, until the leeks are tender.</li>
        <li>Add the arborio rice, stock and spices and stir well to combine. Turn down the heat and let it simmer for
            20-22 minutes with the lid on, stirring every few minutes to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of
            the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the frozen peas, turn off the heat and put the lid back on the pot. Let the rice sit for a few
            minutes to allow the peas to warm.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
