# odin-recipes
My first odin project using HTML.
In this project I will make a recipe website using HTML!

By the end of this project I should have demonstrated the following skills:
- Created GitHub repository for the project and cloned to my local device
- Created README and other HTML project files
- Created HTML files for a recipe website that include various elements (eg. boilerplate, meta info, headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists)
- Use Git to Stage, Commit, and Push this project to my GitHub repository
